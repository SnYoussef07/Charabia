/**
 * Represents a game of Charabia.
 * 
 * Charabia is a word game where players must find the longest word 
 * constructed from letters.
 * 
 * The letters are drawn from a bag of tile. 
 * Each tile, as in Scrabble, has a letter and a value.
 * 
 * The winner of a round is the player who found the longest word.
 * If both players have found a word of same length, both player win the round.
 * His score is increased by the sum of the value of the letters of his word.
 * 
 * The game can be in several states.
 *  - CONFIGURE: the game hasn't started and waits for exactly 2 players to join.
 *  - STARTED: just after the last player has joined, and until the round is over.
 *  - ROUND_OVER: both players played (proposed a word)
 *  - GAME_OVER: round is over and there is not enough tile to play a new round.
